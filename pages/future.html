        <h2>The Future of Technology in Healthcare:</h2>
        <div class = "sub">
            <p>The development of technology in healthcare is nowhere near the end, it is only getting more prominent as people continue to discover new technologies. According to Humanities University, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality is used in many situations such as training doctors and surgeons. It also helps students prepare for real-life surgeries and operations and helps surgeons improve their skills. Based on a recent study, those trained with VR training had a 230% increase in overall performance compared to those who are traditionally trained. VR can also be used to help with pain management during labor and post-surgery.</p>

            <p>Moreover, Artificial Intelligence will continue to be used and improved in healthcare. According to HIMSS, it may be able to help with clinical decisions and diagnosis such as how many days a patient needs to stay in the hospital by accessing a wide range of data and analyzing them. As AI algorithms become more precise and accurate, their access to a wide range of data can allow them to predict results and improve them with better medicines. Besides, Healthcare Insights states that wearable and implanted healthcare technology will continue to improve. These devices can monitor certain health parameters and automatically do something about it. This allows patients to monitor their health and manage it quicker.</p>

            <p>Finally, Humanities University claims that robots are one of the most rapidly developing healthcare technologies. According to Advent Health University, robots could potentially be able to perform lab tests, take tissue biopsies, and medical procedures such as removing plaque from arteries.</p>
