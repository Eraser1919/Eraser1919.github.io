            <h2>Positives:</h2>
            <p>Technology in healthcare has helped many healthcare workers and patients, making healthcare more accessible, efficient, and more.</p>
            <p>Technology in healthcare can increase efficiency and accessibility. For example, AIMS Education states that Telemedicine or Telehealth is a video health consultation or transmission of medical data. This shortens patients’ waiting times, making it more efficient and reducing costs. It also improves medical access in rural areas as more people can be reached. According to UNO technologies, another example is Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) or Electronic Health Records (EHRs) which provide easier access to medical records. EMRs and EHRs store the patient’s medical records electronically which allows access to their medical records no matter where they are or when it is.</p>

            <p>Healthcare technology can also let us know more about our health. For example, according to Humanitas University, wearable technologies increase our understanding of our health as they can monitor our health. For example, the Fitbit watches can monitor our sleep cycle and track workouts. AIMS Education also mentions that mobile health apps can provide better awareness of their health and assist communication between healthcare providers and patients. Mobile health apps can help with medical referrals, chronic health management, women’s health, mental health, and more.</p>

            <h2>Negatives:</h2>
            <p>While technology in healthcare has many benefits, there are also some negative impacts. Some concerns include privacy and cybersecurity, cost, ethical concerns, and more.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest concerns about EMRs and EHRs is cybersecurity risks. While putting medical records can improve efficiency and access, Galen Data says that protected healthcare information could also be exposed or released, whether intentionally or not. According to AIMS Education, in 2015, the second largest insurance company in the US, Anthem, was hacked. About 80 million customers' and employees’ names and addresses were stolen. Even though this was a big company, information was still stolen, which shows the risks of storing personal information online. Galen Data also states that if the data is altered, it can impact a patient’s diagnosis, treatment, and more.</p>

            <p>According to Tech Times, another concern is the increased cost of medical treatment. Even though technology improves the efficiency of healthcare, reducing the cost, it can also increase it. This is because developing new medical treatments and using these technologies can cause quite a bit. Moreover, Tech Times states that there are ethical concerns about some of these technologies, especially genetic testing. This is because genetic testing can cause discrimination against people with the risk of certain conditions, such as Huntington's disease. Finally, Tech Times warns that over-relying on technology can increase the risk of decreased levels of critical thinking and decision-making skills. This can result in more errors in diagnosis and treatments when technology is unable to help.</p>
